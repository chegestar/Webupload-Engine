Web Upload Engine for MeeGo Social Networking Uploads
=====================================================

0. About

Web Upload Engine serves as a central point for uploading media content
to social networks. Web Upload Engine is a suite of tools that prepare,
process, queue, and upload the content with the help of specialized plugins 
(destinations).

Web Upload Engine integrates with Accounts and Single Sign-On libraries in MeeGo.
This gives possibility to have unified account management for all uploads and
enables unified handling of all social networking destinations in Share UI
through the single Share UI plugin that exposes all accounts which have "sharing"
service defined for them (which means these services have corresponding web upload
engine plugin).

In order to allow fine tuned configuration for the media being uploaded, Web Upload Engine
defines helper library for publishing widgets that can be used by Share UI web upload plugin
to expose destination-specific UI for specified media content.

Web Upload Engine includes MetaWriter, a tool to clean up media files from the metadata that
isn't reasonable to share with social networks.

Web Upload Engine itself allows to run plugins as separate processes to increase
privilege separation and decrease exposure of accounts information between plugins.
This feature is enabled by default and is controlled via 

CONFIG += process-split

option in QMake configuration
