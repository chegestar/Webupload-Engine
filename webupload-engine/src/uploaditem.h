  \class  UploadItem
  \brief  This class contains details of one upload. The UploadEngine
          maintains a linked list (**temporary data structure**) of instances
          of this class, one instance per valid upload request. A valid upload
          request is one which is either not completed yet, or if it has an
          error, the error is a recoverable error.
